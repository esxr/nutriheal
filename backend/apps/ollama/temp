It is a systematic approach to software development that emphasizes planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Software engineers use a variety of tools, technologies, and methodologies to develop high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software products that meet the needs of their users. They also collaborate with stakeholders such as customers, developers, testers, and operations staff throughout the software development lifecycle. The ultimate goal of software engineering is to produce software systems that are efficient, effective, and easy to use, while minimizing risks, costs, and time-to-market."
